# CGPA-SGPA-calculator
This project is a custom-built CGPA Calculator designed specifically for my university. As a B.Tech CSE student, I realized that there was no readily available or official tool to help students calculate their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) accurately and easily.

Many of my classmates and I often found ourselves manually calculating our CGPA each semester, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. To solve this problem, I decided to take the initiative and build a dedicated CGPA calculator using my technical skills.
